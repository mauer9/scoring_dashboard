# Model Scoreboard

The scoring dashboard project is designed to evaluate the performance of credit approval machine learning models.

It provides a comprehensive overview of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. The dashboard allows users to analyze the models' performance across different time frames, datasets, and features.

With the help of the dashboard, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions on improving the model's performance and optimizing the credit approval process.

Contributions are always welcome!
